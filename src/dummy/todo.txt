To be fixed

- Mobile :
  -* Chat: Text size, image size should be reduced.
  -* Nav: A size of back button / menu button should be reduced
  -* When 'select' the bot, the bot description should be collapsed. 
  -* Because of chrome/safari interface, 'screen cut' issue occurs. This should be fixed in design-wise. 
  - white space top and bottom

- Desktop : 
  -* Bot can be selected duplicately

- Overall :
  -* When menu is clicked on dashboard route, 'Bots' text is shown on the top left. 
  - i.e, when access the webpage with /project/AIOT route, it is not working. 
  - 'Timestamp' on Dashboard should be simple
  - Good functioning LOGIN/OUT process?


* To be discussed
- When download JSON, we can serve json from back-end ideally. However, because the chat speed is controlled in front-end, back-end chat log is still on working. Therefore chat view on front-end side and back-end JSON are not going to be the same. 
  Solution: 
  1. create new JSON file in front-end.
  2. controlling chat speed in back-end

- on chat: there is only one intent in msg data?


DONE: 
- Refactoring / Logical Routing

- Cookie Banner
  -> done: Pop up notification is built.

- Mobile Design and Details
  - project view is clicked on mobile and "choose button" should be floating or seen. 
    -> done: I put selection button on the top, not at the bottom of the description. 

  - by choosing a new project, any other opened project should be collapsed back, same thing should adapt to bot selection.
    -> functional problem. When choosing a new project and collapsing opened one, the scroll stays at the bottom of the new project description. Does it necessary to be changed?
    -> The reason that we didn't collapse other bot was that user might want to see other bots info in parallel. 
     
  - instead of hiding elements, implement hooks with event listeners which are activated by resizing the viewport and replacing components with pure mobile ones. 
    -> I keep the way of hiding elements. 


- Download Button / QR code / New ... Button
  - Finished all function except download JSON
